# Code documentation for Automatic Evaluation based on machine learning approach 
 Step 1
We read the data from the data set which contains 
Source documents : contain 100 text divided to 10 groups each group belongs to a specific topic
Candidate summary :  we have 90 candidate summary generated by 9 different system 
Reference summary : we have 30 references summary so for 
              Each topic we have three references 
Notes: 
These is summarization systems belong to Multi inputs single output type.
We just have some challenges to Rearrange and read the data in correct way.

Step 2
We make a preprocessing step for each text in our data 
Hint:
We have been calculating differ kind of score through different kind of similarity which we can categorize them to three groups:
Similarity between the candidate text summary and reference summary: which can be calculated through Rough score and MeMoG score .
Similarity between the candidate text summary and source documents : which can be calculated through SIMetrix.
Extract Lexical Feature from the candidate summary: as Number of verbs and nouns and density of verbs and nouns 
Step 3
Preparing the wanted scores (or selected features)
1-ROUGE: we pass to it the candidate summary and the reference summary , we have 3 references for each candidate so we take the average of them, and calculate Rouge 1, Rouge 2, Rouge 3 and Rouge 4
MeMoG: we pass to it the candidate summary  and the reference summary  we have 3 references for each candidate through these 3 references generating the merged graph which compared with the candidate graph 
Lexical Features : for the candidate summary we pass it to a POS and have a list of Nouns  and verbs then calculate the Number of Nouns and verbs in each candidate summary and after that calculate the density of each type in each  candidate summary 

SIMetrix : we pass to it frequency of each word in candidate summary and in the input source  then calculate the divergence from the input to candidate and the divergence from the candidate to source input and then calculating the smoothed version of it 

At this step we have a 12 Feature and we just use 11of them and eliminate just Rouge 1.


    Step 4
We pass these feature to our classifiers and make some experiments to  get the best result and also read the insight from the results of these experiments .
